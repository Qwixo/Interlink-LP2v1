                  I understand that making the decision to study abroad can feel overwhelming. The cost, the distance from home, 
                  the uncertainty of success â€“ these are all valid concerns that many of our students had before taking the leap.

                  But here's what I've seen after helping hundreds of international students: those who take this step almost 
                  always look back and say it was the best decision they ever made. Not just for their careers, but for their 
                  personal growth and confidence.

                  The truth is, there will never be a "perfect" time to make this change. What matters is having the right 
                  support system â€“ and that's exactly what we provide at Interlink. We've designed our programs specifically 
                  for students like you, with all the guidance and resources you need to succeed.
